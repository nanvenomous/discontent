### discontent ðŸ˜•

apologies in advance for another content management system (cms)

#### why?
- not an application framework
    - byo-auth & permisioning
- nosql (I'm using mongodb)
    - hopefully take advantage of the flexibility
- single binary deployment
    - take advantage of modern server side rendering libraries (like `a-h/templ` & `bigskysoftware/htmx`)
- simple & extensible (still working on some of this part, but these are the goals)
    - hopefully allow other DB's, but maybe with fewer features for structured databases
    - expose the handlers, deploy & extend this thing any way you want
    - expose the data methods (go sdk out of the box)
